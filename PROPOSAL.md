## Genetic Algorithm Simulator  
A Genetic Algorithm is an algorithm that improves its model on a task after running many "generations" of simulations.  
My proposed simulation is one where a computer-controlled "subject" is dot on a 2D playing field. The subject can 



Genetic Algorithm with physics  
Get from starting point to end point  
Random force and direction  
Best genetics pass on through weighted parent algoritm (single parent?)  
Display each generation  
Speed up viewing  
Toggle visuals for processing speed  
Obstacles
